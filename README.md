  ## Description
  In this project we were asked to create a blog website using the model-view-controller (MVC) framework. This framework divides up responsibility into the three aforementioned categories, making it easier to manage bugs and issues. We also used express-session to limit the content users can see if they are not logged in. Before logging in, the user can only see the blog posts on the homepage and cannot do anything other than read them. Once logged in, the user is able to create posts, edit their previous posts, comment on other user's posts, and delete previous posts that they no longer need. 
  ## Installation
  There are a lot of npm packages required for this app to work, all of them are listed below. If you clone my repository all you will need to do is run npm i in the root directory, since all the packages listed are already in the package.json that will be present in the cloned repository. 
  ## Usage
  To use this app, simply use the deployed application link at the top of this readMe.
